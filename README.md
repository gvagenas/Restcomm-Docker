Using the Restcomm docker image you will be able to run Restcomm with the minimum effort and no pain.

Restcomm binds to the ip address of the host and following ports:

* __http__: 8080
* __sip/udp__: 5080
* __sip/tcp__: 5080
* __sip/ws__: 5082 (Used for WebRTC)
* __rtp/udp__: 65000 - 65535

Please report any issues at https://github.com/gvagenas/Restcomm-Docker/issues

__Important Notice for Restcomm networking__

When using a sip client that is not running on the same machine as the Restcomm docker image, for example when calling from sip desk phone to Restcomm docker image, you won't be able to properly setup the call and receive any RTP traffic, because Restcomm docker image will be using the ip address of the container, that docker assigned to the container, thus all the SIP and SDP messages will be tagged with the container's ip address that can't be reached outside the local machine.

The fix for that is to provide the IP Address of the host machine using the STATIC_ADDRESS environment variable so Restcomm will properly configured:

``` docker run -e  VOICERSS_KEY="YOUR_VOICESS_KEY_HERE" -e STATIC_ADDRESS="YOUR_HOST_IP_ADDRESS_HERE" -e OUTBOUND_PROXY="YOUR_OUTBOUND_PROXY_HERE" --name=restcomm -d -p 8080:8080 -p 5080:5080 -p 5082:5082  -p 5080:5080/udp -p 65000-65535:65000-65535/udp gvagenas/restcomm:latest```

Using the STATIC_ADDRESS and given that the sip client can reach the host's ip address, you will be able now to properly setup a call and receive RTP traffic.
***

__Quick test__

After you started the Restcomm container, you can quickly make a call to verify that everything works by using the Olympus WebRTC applicatin that is shipped with Restcomm.

1. Point your browser to ```http://HOST_IP_ADDRESS:8080/olympus```
2. Press "Sign in"
3. Your browser will ask for permission to share microphone and camera, press allow
4. Go to "Contact", click on the "+1234" and press the "Audio Call" button (phone icon)
5. You should hear the "Welcome to Restcomm, a Telestax Sponsored project" announcement

To stop container: _docker stop restcomm_

To start container: _docker start restcomm_

To remove container: _docker rm restcomm_

### Persist your work using shared filesystem

You can persist the logs, database, recordings, text-to-speech cache and RVD workspace using shared filesystem, so even if you stop and remove your container, your work won't be lost.

Download the [__restcomm_workspace__](https://github.com/gvagenas/Restcomm-Docker/blob/master/restcomm_workspace.zip?raw=true) that contains the default database, default RVD workspace and the required folders and unzip it to a folder in your filesystem.

Next run Restcomm image using the following volume arguments:

* Restcomm logs ```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/log:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/log ```
* Restcomm recordings ```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/recordings:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/recordings```
* Restcomm tts cache ```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/cache:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/cache```
* Restcomm HSQL database ```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/data:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/data/hsql```
* Media Server logs  
```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/mms/log:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/mediaserver/log```
* Restcomm Visual Designer workspace  ```-v $YOUR_FOLDER/restcomm_workspace/rvd/workspace:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm-rvd.war/workspace```

For example if you unzip the _restcomm_workspace.zip_ to /opt/restcomm_workspace/ then the docker run command will be:
```docker run --name=restcomm --restart=always -d -e VOICERSS_KEY="YOUR_VOICERSS_KEY" -p 8080:8080 -p 5080:5080 -p 5080:5080/udp -p 65000-65535/udp -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/log:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/log -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/recordings:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/recordings -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/cache:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/cache -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/restcomm/data:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/data/hsql -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/mms/log:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/mediaserver/log -v /opt/restcomm_workspace/rvd/workspace:/opt/Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm-rvd.war/workspace gvagenas/restcomm:latest```



### To get bash console (for debugging only)

You can start the container and get a bash console to manually setup Restcomm and test it using the following command:

```docker run --name=restcomm --entrypoint=/bin/bash -it -p 8080:8080 -p 5080:5080 -p 5082:5082 -p 5080:5080/udp -p 65000-65535/udp gvagenas/restcomm:latest```

### To execute a command at the container

```docker exec rc [command]```

For example

```docker exec rc ps -ef | grep java```
